# C4 Infrastructure, Configuration & Deployment Security

## Control Objective

AI-specific infrastructure components must be hardened against model theft, data leakage, and cross-tenant contamination. This chapter covers AI workload sandboxing, AI accelerator hardware security, and edge/distributed AI deployment security.

---

## C4.1 AI Workload Sandboxing & Validation

Isolate untrusted AI models in secure sandboxes and protect sensitive AI workloads using trusted execution environments (TEEs) and confidential computing technologies.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---: |
| **4.1.1** | **Verify that** AI models execute in isolated sandboxes. | 1 |
| **4.1.2** | **Verify that** model artifact loading enforces an explicit allowlist of serialization formats that do not permit arbitrary code execution during deserialization.| 1 |
| **4.1.3** | **Verify that** workload attestation is performed before model loading to provide proof that the execution environment has not been tampered with. | 3 |
| **4.1.4** | **Verify that** confidential inference services protect model weights during runtime through isolated execution environments. | 3 |

## C4.2 AI Hardware Security

Secure AI-specific hardware components including GPUs, TPUs, and specialized AI accelerators.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---: |
| **4.2.1** | **Verify that** execution within a trusted execution environment (TEE) provides hardware-enforced isolation, memory encryption, and integrity protection. | 3 |
| **4.2.2** | **Verify that** AI accelerator (GPU) integrity is validated using hardware-based attestation mechanisms before each workload executes. | 3 |
| **4.2.3** | **Verify that** accelerator (GPU) memory is isolated between workloads through partitioning mechanisms with memory sanitization between jobs. | 3 |
| **4.2.4** | **Verify that** AI accelerator (GPU) firmware is version-pinned, signed, and attested at boot. | 2 |
| **4.2.5** | **Verify that** accelerator interconnects are restricted to approved topologies and authenticated endpoints. | 3 |

## C4.3 Edge & Distributed AI Security

Secure distributed AI deployments including edge computing, federated learning, and multi-site architectures.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---: |
| **4.3.1** | **Verify that** edge AI devices authenticate to central infrastructure using strong authentication. | 1 |
| **4.3.2** | **Verify that** models deployed to edge or mobile devices are cryptographically signed during packaging, and that the on-device runtime validates these signatures or checksums before loading or inference. | 2 |
| **4.3.3** | **Verify that** inference runtimes enforce process, memory, and file access isolation. | 3 |
| **4.3.4** | **Verify that** model weights and sensitive parameters stored locally are encrypted using hardware-backed key stores or secure enclaves. | 3 |
| **4.3.5** | **Verify that** models packaged within mobile, IoT, or embedded applications are encrypted at rest, and decrypted only inside a trusted runtime or secure enclave, preventing direct extraction from the app package or filesystem. | 3 |
