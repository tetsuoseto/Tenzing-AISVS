# Appendix D: AI Security Controls Inventory

## Objective

This appendix provides a concise inventory of every security control and defense technique referenced across the AISVS requirements. Controls are grouped by security control category so that implementers can find all related defenses in one place regardless of which AISVS chapter defines them.

---

## AD.1 Authentication

Verify the identity of users, agents, services, MCP clients/servers, and edge devices before granting access.

| Control / Technique | Requirement IDs |
| --- | --- |
| Step-up authentication for high-risk AI operations (model deployment, weight export, training data access) | 5.1.1 |
| Short-lived signed tokens for federated AI agent authentication | 5.1.2 |
| Unique cryptographic agent and orchestrator identity | 9.4.1 |

| Cryptographically secure MCP session IDs (not used for auth) | 10.2.8 |

**Common pitfalls:** reusing end-user credentials for agent-to-agent calls; using MCP session IDs as authentication tokens; not rotating agent credentials on suspected compromise.

---

## AD.2 Authorization & Access Control

**Common pitfalls:** setting rate limits per-endpoint but not per-agent-session; not accounting for tool fan-out when calculating budgets; missing circuit breakers on recursive agent chains.

| Automatic blocking or fallback when confidence drops below a defined threshold | 7.2.2 |
| Model output calibration to reduce overconfident predictions exploitable by membership inference | 11.3.1 |

**Common pitfalls:** providing explanations that expose system prompts or internal architecture; treating LLM-generated rationales as faithful descriptions of model internals; not calibrating uncertainty estimates such that downstream gates cannot trust them.

---

## AD.19 Human Oversight & Approval Gates

Require human review and approval for high-impact, irreversible, or safety-critical actions, and provide reliable shutdown and graceful-degradation paths under human control. Effective human oversight requires four cooperating layers: a **documented policy** that classifies which actions are high-risk and is wired to the runtime gate (C9.2.1), a **runtime gate** that blocks execution until approval is received (C9.2), **kill-switch and graceful-degradation mechanisms** to halt or constrain the system when needed (C9.6), and **independent audit trails** for both approvals (C13.6.4) and human-initiated overrides (C9.6.4). Each layer is separately verifiable; an approval gate without a policy is unenforceable, a policy without a runtime gate is unenforced, and either without audit trails is unattributable.

| Control / Technique | Requirement IDs |
| --- | --- |
| High-impact action approval gates (deploy, delete, financial, notify), as defined by a documented policy | 9.2.1 |
| Approval parameter binding (prevent approve-one-execute-another) | 9.2.2 |

| Fail-closed default action (block pending action) when human approval is not received within TTL | 9.6.3 |
| Human review on anomaly detection | 11.6.3 |
| High-risk model quarantine with human review and sign-off | 6.1.3 |
| Manual kill-switch to halt model inference and outputs | 9.6.1 |
| Intermediate operational degradation states (tool disable, model swap, read-only, source removal) | 9.6.2 |
| Human-override event logging (kill-switch activations, state transitions, override commands) | 9.6.4 |
| Recurring exercise of kill-switch and intermediate-state mechanisms with response-time verification | 9.6.5 |
| Out-of-band override and kill-switch channel for autonomous agents | 9.6.6 |

**Common pitfalls:** documenting a high-risk action policy that is never wired to a runtime gate; binding approval to a hash of parameters without binding to identity or context (replay across sessions); confirmation tokens without quick expiration; defaulting to fail-open when the approver does not respond, silently bypassing the gate; assuming an in-band kill-switch will work against a compromised agent; kill-switch implemented but never exercised, atrophying until the moment it is needed.
