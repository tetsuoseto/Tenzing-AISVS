## AD.19 Human Oversight & Approval Gates

Require human review and approval for high-impact, irreversible, or safety-critical actions.

| Control / Technique | Requirement IDs |
| --- | --- |
| High-impact action approval gates (deploy, delete, financial, notify) | 9.2.1 |
| Approval parameter binding (prevent approve-one-execute-another) | 9.2.2 |
| High-impact intent confirmation with exact parameter binding and quick expiration | 9.7.2 |
| High-risk MCP action confirmation (data deletion, financial, system config) | 10.5.3 |
| Human approval for high-risk content generation | 7.3.5 |
| Human review on uncertainty threshold breach | 14.6.2 |
| Human review on anomaly detection | 11.6.3 |
| Enhanced monitoring and human intervention on security warnings | 11.8.3 |
| Security-critical proactive action approval with approval chain logging | 13.8.4 |
| High-risk model quarantine with human review and sign-off | 6.1.3 |
| Post-condition outcome checking with containment on mismatch | 9.7.3 |
| Compensating actions and transactional rollback on failure | 9.2.3 |
| Intermediate operational degradation states (tool disable, model swap, read-only, source removal) | 14.1.5 |

**Common pitfalls:** not binding approval to exact parameters allowing bait-and-switch; confirmation tokens without quick expiration; missing post-condition checks after approved actions execute.

## AD.20 Hardware & Accelerator Security

Secure AI accelerator hardware, firmware, memory, interconnects, and edge devices.

| Control / Technique | Requirement IDs |
| --- | --- |
| GPU/TPU integrity validation with hardware attestation (TPM, DRTM) | 4.7.1 |
| GPU memory isolation and sanitization between workloads and tenants | 4.7.2 |
| Signed GPU firmware with version pinning and attestation | 4.7.3 |
| VRAM zeroing and device reset between jobs | 4.7.4 |
| MIG / VM GPU partitioning with peer-to-peer access prevention | 4.7.5 |
| HSM with FIPS 140-3 Level 3 certification | 4.7.6 |
| Authenticated accelerator interconnects (NVLink, PCIe, InfiniBand, RDMA) | 4.7.7 |
| Accelerator telemetry export (power, temperature, error correction) | 4.7.8 |
| Edge device secure boot with firmware rollback protection | 4.8.3 |
| Model signature verification on edge devices | 4.8.2 |
| Mobile verified boot, code signing, and runtime integrity checks | 4.8.4 |
| Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus for distributed AI | 4.8.5 |
| On-device process, memory, and file access isolation | 4.8.7 |
| Model obfuscation and decryption inside trusted runtime | 4.8.9 |
| Secure offline edge operation with hardware-backed encrypted local storage | 4.8.10 |

**Common pitfalls:** not zeroing VRAM between tenant workloads; running debug firmware in production; allowing unencrypted interconnects in multi-tenant GPU clusters; neglecting firmware update attestation.
