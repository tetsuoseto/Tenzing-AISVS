# Appendix B: AI Security Controls Inventory

## Objective

This appendix is a consolidated, developer-facing inventory of the security controls mandated across the AISVS requirements. Controls are grouped by control family so an implementer can find all related defenses in one place, regardless of which chapter defines them, and each control links back to the AISVS requirement IDs that mandate it.

This inventory is non-normative. It reorganizes existing requirements for ease of implementation and does not add, remove, or change any requirement. The requirement chapters (C1 through C12) remain the source of truth. Requirement IDs are written in canonical `C{chapter}.{section}.{requirement}` form (for example, `C5.1.1`). Every numbered requirement in the standard appears in exactly one control family below, so the inventory can be checked for completeness against the chapters.

## AD.1 Authentication & Identity

Verify the identity of users, agents, services, edge devices, and MCP clients/servers before granting access.

| Control / Technique | Requirement IDs |
| --- | --- |
| Step-up authentication for high-risk AI operations (model deployment, weight export, training-data access, production configuration changes) | C5.1.1 |
| Short-lived, minimal-scoped, cryptographically signed tokens for federated or multi-system agent authentication | C5.1.2 |
| Strong authentication of edge AI devices to central infrastructure | C4.3.1 |
| Unique cryptographic identity per agent instance, authenticating as a first-class principal to downstream systems | C9.4.1 |
| Scheduled rotation of agent identity credentials | C9.4.3 |
| MCP per-request access-token validation (not transport security alone) | C10.2.1 |
| MCP access-token claim validation (issuer, audience, expiration, scope) per OAuth 2.1 | C10.2.2 |
| MCP resource servers do not store or persist access tokens or user credentials | C10.2.3 |
| Removal of all MCP session artifacts on session termination | C10.2.6 |
| No pass-through of client access tokens to downstream APIs | C10.2.7 |
| Sender-constrained MCP access tokens (mTLS or DPoP) | C10.3.5 |

**Common pitfalls:** reusing end-user credentials for agent-to-agent calls; not rotating agent credentials on suspected compromise; treating transport security as a substitute for per-request token validation.

---

## AD.2 Authorization & Access Control

Enforce access decisions across users, agents, tools, and resources using policy that the model cannot override.

| Control / Technique | Requirement IDs |
| --- | --- |
| Access controls on every AI resource (datasets, endpoints, vector collections, embedding indices, compute) with explicit allow-lists and default-deny | C5.2.1 |
| End-user authorization context enforced at each retrieval and assembly stage, not the service account alone | C5.2.2 |
| Post-inference filtering so responses exclude data the requester is not entitled to receive | C5.2.4 |
| Policy decision point isolated from the agent execution environment | C5.2.5 |
| Just-in-time privileged access to model weights, training pipelines, and production configuration with automatic expiry | C5.2.6 |
| Fine-grained, runtime-enforced authorization of agent actions (which tools, which parameter values) | C9.5.1 |
| Integrity-protected, scope-limited delegation token propagated to every downstream call | C9.5.2 |
| Access-control decisions enforced by application logic or a policy engine, never by the model | C9.5.3 |
| Inter-agent task delegation restricted by an explicit authorization policy | C9.5.5 |
| Re-evaluation of backend authorization on every privileged action in long-running sessions | C9.5.6 |
| Scope-filtered MCP tool discovery (tools/list returns only authorized tools) | C10.2.4 |
| Per-invocation MCP access control validating both the tool and the supplied argument values | C10.2.5 |

**Common pitfalls:** relying on the service account's permissions instead of the caller's; letting model-generated output drive authorization; not re-checking authorization when context changes mid-session.

---

## AD.3 Data Classification & Tenant Isolation

Keep data within its authorization and tenancy boundaries as it flows through AI-specific transformations and shared infrastructure.

| Control / Technique | Requirement IDs |
| --- | --- |
| Sensitive data served through retrieval pipelines rather than persisted into model weights | C5.2.3 |
| Classification labels propagated to downstream resources (embeddings, prompt caches, model outputs) | C5.2.7 |
| Cross-tenant isolation in shared model serving (fine-tuning, inference, embedding operations) | C5.3.1 |
| Cross-tenant isolation across shared compute (hardware partitioning, confidential computing, or dedicated allocation) | C5.3.2 |

**Common pitfalls:** dropping classification labels when data is embedded or cached; assuming logical multi-tenancy is sufficient against side channels in shared inference caches.

---

## AD.4 Encryption & Data Protection

Protect data and secrets at rest, in transit, and in the model's observable context.

| Control / Technique | Requirement IDs |
| --- | --- |

| Secrets and credentials kept out of the model's observable context (context window, system prompts, tool-call parameters) | C9.5.4 |

**Common pitfalls:** encrypting the database but not model checkpoints or embeddings; leaving model weights extractable from an app package; exposing API keys inside tool-call parameters.

---

## AD.5 Integrity, Signing & Provenance

| Control / Technique | Requirement IDs |
| --- | --- |
| Integrity monitoring of training data against unauthorized modification or corruption | C1.1.4 |

| Signature verification at deployment admission and on load | C3.1.3 |
| Signed edge/mobile model packages with on-device signature or checksum validation before load | C4.3.2 |

| Anomaly detection on external or untrusted inputs before inference | C11.4.1 |
| Gating actions on inputs flagged as anomalous | C11.4.2 |

**Common pitfalls:** validating only the text modality while ignoring image/audio channels; relying on regex alone without semantic detection; not validating tool and MCP outputs before they re-enter agent context.

---

## AD.7 Inbound Content & Policy Screening

Screen prompts and training content against policy before they reach the model or the training pipeline.
