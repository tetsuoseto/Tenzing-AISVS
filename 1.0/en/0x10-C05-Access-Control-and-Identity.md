# C5 Access Control & Identity for AI Components & Users

## Control Objective

AI systems introduce access control challenges beyond traditional application security: classification labels must follow data through AI-specific transformations (embeddings, caches, model outputs), multi-tenant inference infrastructure creates novel side channels, and retrieval-augmented pipelines must enforce caller entitlements at every stage. This chapter addresses AI-specific access control and identity concerns, including runtime isolation of the policy decision point from agent execution and authorization-aware output filtering where entitlements vary per caller.

## C5.1 Authentication

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **5.1.1** | **Verify that** high-risk AI operations (model deployment, weight export, training data access, production configuration changes) require step-up authentication. | 3 |
| **5.1.2** | **Verify that** AI agents in federated or multi-system deployments authenticate using short-lived, minimal-scoped, cryptographically signed tokens. | 3 |

## C5.2 AI Resource Authorization & Classification

Enforce the caller's authorization context through AI-specific query pipelines (RAG retrieval, embedding lookups, inference chains) so that the AI system does not return data that the caller is not entitled to access.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **5.2.1** | **Verify that** every AI resource (datasets, endpoints, vector collections, embedding indices, compute instances) enforces access controls with explicit allow-lists and default-deny policies. | 2 |
| **5.2.2** | **Verify that** retrieval pipelines (e.g., RAG queries, embedding lookups) enforce the end-user's authorization context at each retrieval and assembly stage, rather than relying solely on the service account's permissions. | 2 |
| **5.2.3** | **Verify that** sensitive data is retrieved via retrieval pipelines (e.g., RAG queries, embedding lookups) to prevent permanent storage in models. | 2 |
| **5.2.4** | **Verify that** post-inference filtering mechanisms prevent responses from including data that the requestor is not authorized to receive. | 2 |
| **5.2.5** | **Verify that** the policy decision point for agent authorization is isolated from the agent's execution environment. | 2 |
| **5.2.6** | **Verify that** privileged access to model weights, training pipelines, and production AI configuration is granted just in time, with a defined maximum session duration and automatic expiry. Zero Standing Privilege (ZSP) to these resources is encouraged. | 3 |
| **5.2.7** | **Verify that** data classification labels propagate to downstream resources (embeddings, prompt caches, model outputs). | 3 |

## C5.3 Multi-Tenant Isolation

Prevent cross-tenant information leakage through AI-specific shared infrastructure components such as inference caches and shared model state.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **5.3.1** | **Verify that** shared model serving infrastructure prevents one tenant's fine-tuning, inference, or embedding operations from influencing or observing another tenant's operations. | 2 |
| **5.3.2** | **Verify that** one tenant cannot influence or observe another tenant's operations through shared compute resources. Satisfying this requirement typically requires hardware partitioning, confidential computing, or dedicated per-tenant compute allocation. | 3 |
