# C5 Access Control & Identity for AI Components & Users

## Control Objective

AI systems introduce access control challenges beyond traditional application security: classification labels must follow data through AI-specific transformations (embeddings, caches, model outputs), multi-tenant inference infrastructure creates novel side channels, and retrieval-augmented pipelines must enforce caller entitlements at every stage. 

This chapter addresses AI-specific access control and identity concerns only. General identity management and authentication (centralized IdP, federation, MFA, step-up authentication) are covered by ASVS v5 V6. General authorization patterns (RBAC/ABAC design, externalized PDP, dynamic attribute evaluation, policy caching), access control audit logging, and multi-tenant networking are covered by ASVS v5 V8, V14, and V16. 

Agent-specific authorization policies and delegation are covered in C9.6; single-system agent identity is in C9.4.1; this chapter covers runtime isolation of the policy decision point from agent execution (complementing C9.6.4). Vector database scope enforcement is in C8.1 and C8.5. General output safety filtering (PII redaction, content moderation, confidential data blocking) is in C7.3; this chapter covers authorization-aware output filtering where entitlements vary per caller.

## C5.1 Authentication

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **5.1.1** | **Verify that** high-risk AI operations (model deployment, weight export, training data access, production configuration changes) require step-up authentication with session re-validation. | 2 |
| **5.1.2** | **Verify that** AI agents in federated or multi-system deployments authenticate via short-lived, cryptographically signed authentication tokens (e.g., signed JWT assertions) with a maximum lifetime appropriate to the risk level and including cryptographic proof of origin. | 3 |

## C5.2 AI Resource Authorization & Classification

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **5.2.1** | **Verify that** every AI resource (datasets, models, endpoints, vector collections, embedding indices, compute instances) enforces access controls (e.g., RBAC, ABAC) with explicit allow-lists and default-deny policies. | 1 |
| **5.2.2** | **Verify that** privileged access to model weights, training pipelines, and production AI configuration is provisioned on a just-in-time basis with a defined maximum session duration and automatic expiry, and permanent standing privileged access to these resources is not permitted. | 2 |
| **5.2.3** | **Verify that** data classification labels (PII, PHI, proprietary, etc.) automatically propagate to derived resources (embeddings, prompt caches, model outputs). | 3 |
| **5.2.4** | **Verify that** a documented data classification taxonomy covering AI-specific data types (embeddings, model weights, prompt templates, RAG context assemblies, fine-tuning datasets, agent tool schemas) is defined, and that AI assets are labeled in accordance with this taxonomy. | 2 |

## C5.3 Query-Time Authorization

Enforce the caller's authorization context through AI-specific query pipelines (RAG retrieval, embedding lookups, inference chains) so that the AI system does not return data the caller is not entitled to access.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **5.3.1** | **Verify that** AI inference and retrieval pipelines (e.g., RAG queries, embedding lookups) enforce the end-user's authorization context at each retrieval and assembly stage, rather than relying solely on the service account's permissions. | 1 |

---

## C5.4 Output Entitlement Enforcement

Ensure that AI-generated outputs, including citations and source attributions, respect the caller's data entitlements.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **5.4.1** | **Verify that** post-inference filtering mechanisms prevent responses from including classified information or proprietary data that the requestor is not authorized to receive. | 1 |
| **5.4.2** | **Verify that** citations, references, and source attributions in model outputs are validated against caller entitlements and removed if unauthorized access is detected. | 2 |

---

## C5.5 Policy Decision Point Isolation

Ensure that authorization decision infrastructure for AI agents is protected from compromise and manipulation by the agents it governs.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **5.5.1** | **Verify that** the policy decision point for agent authorization is isolated from the agent's execution environment such that a compromised agent runtime cannot influence or bypass evaluation. | 3 |
| **5.5.2** | **Verify that** the policy decision point receives structured action descriptions (e.g., action type, target resource, parameters) rather than the agent's raw reasoning context. | 3 |

---

## C5.6 Multi-Tenant Isolation

Prevent cross-tenant information leakage through AI-specific shared infrastructure components such as inference caches and shared model state.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **5.6.1** | **Verify that** inference-time KV-cache entries are partitioned by authenticated session or tenant identity and that automatic prefix caching does not share cached prefixes across distinct security principals, to prevent timing-based prompt reconstruction attacks. | 2 |
| **5.6.2** | **Verify that** shared model serving infrastructure prevents one tenant's fine-tuning, inference, or embedding operations from influencing or observing another tenant's operations through shared model state, adapter weights, or compute resources. | 2 |
