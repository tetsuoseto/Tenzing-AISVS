# C8 Memory, Embeddings & Vector Database Security

## Control Objective

Embeddings and vector stores act as semi-persistent and persistent "memory" for AI systems via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This memory can become a high-risk data sink and data exfiltration path. This control family hardens memory pipelines and vector databases so that access is least-privilege, data is sanitized before vectorization, retention is explicit, and systems are resilient to embedding inversion, membership inference, and cross-tenant leakage.

## C8.1 Access Controls on Memory & RAG Indices

Enforce fine-grained access controls and query-time scope enforcement for every vector collection.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--: | --- | :---: |
| **8.1.1** | **Verify that** vector identifiers and namespaces enforce uniqueness per tenant and prevent cross-tenant collisions. | 1 |
| **8.1.2** | **Verify that** every ingested document is tagged at write time with source, writer identity, and timestamp. | 2 |
| **8.1.3** | **Verify that** document metadata tags are immutable after the initial write. | 2 |
| **8.1.4** | **Verify that** RAG pipeline retrieval events are logged, including the query, documents retrieved, and knowledge source. | 2 |
| **8.1.5** | **Verify that** retrieval operations enforces scope constraints. | 2 |

## C8.2 Embedding Sanitization & Validation

Pre-screen content before vectorization and treat memory writes as untrusted inputs to prevent ingestion of unsafe payloads.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--: | --- | :---: |
| **8.2.1** | **Verify that** sensitive fields are detected before embedding and are masked, tokenized, or dropped. | 1 |
| **8.2.2** | **Verify that** content crafted to manipulate retrieval results is detected and rejected or quarantined before vectorization. | 3 |
| **8.2.3** | **Verify that** vectors that fall outside normal clustering patterns are flagged and quarantined before entering production indices. | 2 |
| **8.2.4** | **Verify that** agent outputs and tool outputs are not automatically written to trusted agent memory without explicit source validation. | 2 |
| **8.2.5** | **Verify that** new content written to memory is checked for contradictions with what is already stored and that conflicts trigger alerts. | 3 |

## C8.3 Memory Expiry, Revocation & Leakage Prevention

Retention and revocation must be explicit and enforceable for memory and RAG indices, and systems must address embedding inversion and attribute inference risks.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--: | --- | :---: |
| **8.3.1** | **Verify that** expired vectors are excluded from retrieval results. | 2 |
| **8.3.2** | **Verify that** memory can be reset. | 2 |
| **8.3.3** | **Verify that** quarantined content is retained but excluded from all retrieval results. | 3 |
