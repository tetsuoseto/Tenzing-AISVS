# C2 Input Validation

## Control Objective

Robust validation of all inputs is a first-line defense against some of the most damaging attacks on AI systems. Prompt injection attacks can override system instructions, leak sensitive data, or steer the model toward behavior that is not allowed. Unless dedicated filters and other validation is in place, research shows that jailbreaks that exploit context windows will continue to be effective. In agentic and multi-step systems, inputs from tools, retrieved documents, MCP server responses, and sub-agent outputs carry the same risks as direct user input and require the same validation pipeline. This chapter focuses on threats unique to AI systems: prompt injection, adversarial inputs targeting model behavior, AI-specific content screening, and multi-modal attack vectors including adversarial perturbations, steganographic payloads, and cross-modal attacks.

## C2.1 Prompt Injection Defense

Prompt injection is one of the top risks for AI systems. Defenses against this tactic employ a combination of pattern filters, data classifiers and instruction hierarchy enforcement.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **2.1.1** | **Verify that** all external or derived inputs that may steer model behavior are treated as untrusted and screened by a prompt injection detection ruleset or classifier before being included in prompts or used to trigger actions. | 1 |
| **2.1.2** | **Verify that** input length controls prevent user-supplied content from exceeding a defined proportion of the context window, and that inputs exceeding token limits are rejected rather than silently truncated, ensuring system instructions and safety directives are not displaced from the model's effective attention. | 1 |
| **2.1.3** | **Verify that** the system implements a character set limitation for user inputs to model prompts, allowing only characters that are explicitly required for business purposes using an allow-list approach. | 1 |
| **2.1.4** | **Verify that** prompts originating from third-party content (web pages, PDFs, emails) are sanitized in isolation (for example, stripping instruction-like directives and neutralizing HTML, Markdown, and script content) before being concatenated into the main prompt. | 2 |
| **2.1.5** | **Verify that** the system enforces per-request limits on the number of user-supplied demonstrations included in a single context window. | 2 |
| **2.1.6** | **Verify that** prompt injection screening respects user-specific attributes (e.g., age tier, authorization role, regional content-policy classification) via attribute-based rules resolved at request time, including the role or permission level of the calling agent. | 2 |
| **2.1.7** | **Verify that** the system enforces an instruction hierarchy in which system and developer messages override user instructions and other untrusted inputs, even after processing user instructions. | 3 |
| **2.1.8** | **Verify that** the instruction hierarchy is preserved across multi-step interactions and tool-augmented workflows, including prompt composition and intermediate outputs, such that user-controlled content cannot override system or developer instructions. | 3 |
| **2.1.9** | **Verify that** the system detects patterns indicative of systematic in-context behavioral override attempts consistent with many-shot jailbreaking. | 3 |
| **2.1.10** | **Verify that** detected in-context behavioral override attempts are classified and handled as prompt injection events. | 3 |

## C2.2 Pre-Tokenization Input Normalization

AI models process text through tokenizers and embeddings that can be exploited via encoding tricks invisible to conventional input validation. Normalization before tokenization closes attack vectors such as homoglyph substitution, invisible character injection, and bidirectional text manipulation that bypass standard allow-list filters but alter model behavior. For output-side encoding smuggling in model-generated content, see C7.3.5.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **2.2.1** | **Verify that** input normalization (Unicode NFC canonicalization, homoglyph mapping, removal of control and invisible Unicode characters, and bidirectional text neutralization) is applied before tokenization or embedding. | 1 |
| **2.2.2** | **Verify that** inputs identified as adversarial by any detection mechanism are blocked from inclusion in prompts or execution of actions. | 1 |
| **2.2.3** | **Verify that** inputs which still contain suspicious encoding artifacts after normalization are rejected or flagged for review. | 2 |
| **2.2.4** | **Verify that** encoding and representation smuggling in inputs (e.g., invisible Unicode/control characters, homoglyph swaps, or mixed-direction text) is detected and mitigated. Approved mitigations include canonicalization, strict schema validation, policy-based rejection, or explicit marking. | 3 |

## C2.3 Content & Policy Screening

Syntactically valid prompts may request disallowed content such as policy-violating instructions, harmful content, or restricted material. Input-side content screening prevents such prompts from reaching the model.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **2.3.1** | **Verify that** every inbound prompt is scored by a content classifier for violence, self-harm, hate, and sexual content against configurable thresholds, and that prompts exceeding those thresholds are rejected or sanitized before reaching model context. | 1 |
| **2.3.2** | **Verify that** prompt content classification is evaluated for unsupported-language abuse and that identified gaps are mitigated through compensating controls such as language detection with rejection, conservative thresholds, or human review routing. | 1 |
| **2.3.3** | **Verify that** inputs which violate policies are rejected so they do not propagate to downstream model or tool/MCP calls. | 1 |
| **2.3.4** | **Verify that** screening logs include classifier confidence scores and policy category tags with applied stage (pre-prompt or post-response) and trace metadata (source, tool or MCP server, agent ID, session) for SOC correlation and future red-team replay. | 2 |

## C2.4 Multi-Modal Input Validation

AI systems that accept non-textual inputs (images, audio, video, files) face unique attack vectors where malicious content can be embedded across modalities and extracted into text that feeds the model's context.

| # | Description | Level |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---: |
| **2.4.1** | **Verify that** text extracted from non-text inputs (e.g., image-to-text, speech-to-text) and hidden or embedded content (metadata, layers, alt text, comments) is treated as untrusted and screened per 2.1.1. | 1 |
| **2.4.2** | **Verify that** image/audio inputs are checked for adversarial perturbations, steganographic payloads, or known attack patterns, and detections trigger gating (block or degrade capabilities) before model use. | 3 |
| **2.4.3** | **Verify that** cross-modal attack detection identifies coordinated attacks spanning multiple input types (e.g., steganographic payloads in images combined with prompt injection in text) with correlation rules and alert generation, and that confirmed detections are blocked or require HITL (human-in-the-loop) approval. | 3 |
